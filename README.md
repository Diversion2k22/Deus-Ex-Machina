# Deus Ex Machina

"Autonomous/Reconnaissance/Combat  model Robot tank. It's the 4th prototye.
Will have it's own turret(an EM gun, basically railgun or coilgun). Terrain mapping system using LIDAR and pi or jetson nano(Will add this when i get good in ML). ArduPilot feature so we can create our own waypoint mission and control the tank using GPS data."
